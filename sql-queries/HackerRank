## Solutions

### 1. Get Employee Name
```sql
SELECT name FROM employee ORDER BY name;

2. Get Employee Salary
SELECT name FROM employee WHERE salary > 2000 AND months < 10 ORDER BY employee_id;

3. Query Name of Students with Marks > 75
SELECT name FROM students WHERE marks > 75 ORDER BY RIGHT(name,3), id ASC;

4. WEATHER-3: List CITY names with even ID
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE ID % 2 = 0;

5. WEATHER-4: Difference between total and distinct CITY entries
SELECT COUNT(city) - COUNT(DISTINCT city) FROM station;

6. WEATHER-5: Two cities with shortest and longest names
SELECT city, LENGTH(city) 
FROM station 
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) ASC, city ASC 
LIMIT 1;

SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) 
FROM station 
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city ASC 
LIMIT 1;

7. WEATHER-6: CITY names starting with vowels
SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM station 
WHERE LEFT(city,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

8. WEATHER-7: CITY names ending with vowels
SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM station 
WHERE RIGHT(city,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

9. BINARY TREE: Root, Inner, Leaf
SELECT BT.N,
CASE
    WHEN BT.P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT B.P FROM BST B WHERE B.P = BT.N) THEN 'Inner'
    ELSE 'Leaf'
END
FROM BST AS BT 
ORDER BY BT.N;

10. Founder > LM > SM > M > Emp: Count employees per company
SELECT e.company_code,
       MAX(founder),
       COUNT(DISTINCT lead_manager_code),
       COUNT(DISTINCT senior_manager_code),
       COUNT(DISTINCT manager_code),
       COUNT(DISTINCT employee_code)
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Company c ON e.company_code = c.company_code
GROUP BY e.company_code
ORDER BY e.company_code;

11. TRIANGLE TYPES
SELECT CASE
    WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B OR A = C OR B = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELSE 'Scalene'
END AS triangle_sides
FROM TRIANGLES;

12. PAD CONCAT: Name + Occupation abbreviation
SELECT CONCAT(name,'(',SUBSTRING(Occupation,1,1),')') AS Name 
FROM occupations 
ORDER BY Name;

SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(occupation),' ', LOWER(occupation),'s.') AS totals
FROM occupations
GROUP BY occupation
ORDER BY totals;

13. OCCUPATION Pivot
WITH doctor AS (
    SELECT name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS rn
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    WHERE occupation LIKE 'Doctor'
),
professor AS (
    SELECT name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name) AS rn
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    WHERE occupation LIKE 'Professor'
)
...
SELECT d.name, p.name, s.name, a.name
FROM professor p
LEFT JOIN doctor d ON d.rn = p.rn
LEFT JOIN singer s ON s.rn = p.rn
LEFT JOIN actor a ON a.rn = p.rn;


Alternate:

USING PIVOT SELECT Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor FROM (
    SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY occupation ORDER BY name) as rn, name, occupation 
    FROM occupations
) 
PIVOT (MAX(name) FOR occupation IN ('Doctor' as Doctor,'Professor' as Professor,'Singer' as Singer,'Actor' as Actor))
ORDER BY rn;

14. COUNT: Number of cities with population > 100000
SELECT COUNT(name) FROM city WHERE population > 100000;

15. SUM: Total population in California
SELECT SUM(population) FROM city WHERE district ='California';

16. AVG: Average population in California
SELECT AVG(population) FROM city WHERE district = 'California';

17. Round average population
SELECT ROUND(AVG(population)) FROM city;

18. Population Density Difference
SELECT MAX(population)-MIN(population) AS diff FROM city;

19. Blunder-Miscalculation Ceil
SELECT CEIL(AVG(salary) - AVG(REPLACE(salary, '0', ''))) FROM employees;

20. Max earnings (salary * months)
SELECT salary*months, COUNT(*) 
FROM employee 
WHERE salary*months=(SELECT MAX(salary*months) FROM employee)
GROUP BY salary*months;
